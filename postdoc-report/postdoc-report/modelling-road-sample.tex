For each given $\theta_i$ ($\lambda = 600nm$)

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Fitting parameters:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Oren-Nayar
              
              \item Cook Torrance
              \item Ashikhmin Shirley
              \item Retro-Phong
          \end{itemize}
    \item Relative error and RMSE
\end{enumerate}



Considering all configurations ($\lambda = 600nm$):
